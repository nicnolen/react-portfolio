      Hello, I'm Nicholas Nolen
    </h3>

      <p>
        I am a Full Stack Web Developer leveraging a business background to build sites oriented towards mobile responsiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
         I earned a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development from the University of Texas at Austinâ€™s Web Development Boot Camp with newly developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am known for using time management, attention to detail and strong written and verbal communication to complete even the most complex of tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I applied aspects of front-end development in a recent project. I worked on a team of five to develop an application that allows a travel enthusiast to create an account to log past, upcoming, and bucket-list trips.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy working with a fast-paced, quality-driven team to provide creative solutions to complex problems and exceed project expectations.
