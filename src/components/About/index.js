        <p>
          I am a Full Stack Web Developer leveraging a business background to
          build sites oriented towards mobile responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          {' '}
          I earned a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development from the
          University of Texas at Austinâ€™s Web Development Boot Camp with newly
          developed skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am known for using time management, attention to detail and strong
          written and verbal communication to complete even the most complex of
          tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          I applied aspects of front-end development in a recent project. I
          worked on a team of five to develop an application that allows a
          travel enthusiast to create an account to log past, upcoming, and
          bucket-list trips.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working with a fast-paced, quality-driven team to provide
          creative solutions to complex problems and exceed project
          expectations.
